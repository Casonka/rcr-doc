MPLAB C Compiler for PIC24 MCUs and dsPIC DSCs

If using MPLAB IDE, be sure to install MPLAB IDE v8.10 or later before installing these tools.

To install the MPLAB C Compiler for PIC24 MCUs and dsPIC DSCs (previously MPLAB C30) tools, perform the following steps:

1. Locate the setup program on the compiler CD ROM.

2. Run the setup program.

3. Follow the directions on the screen.

4. If the installation program indicates that it is necessary, reboot your computer to complete the installation.

5. When the installation is complete, verify that the executable directory has been correctly added to your PATH (i.e., if you chose to install the tools in the default directory, c:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30, then ensure that c:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\bin has been added to your PATH). From a DOS prompt, type: c:\>PATH

To verify installation, perform the following steps:

6. At a DOS prompt, go to the examples directory (by default, it is c:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\examples\MPLABC30_Getting_Started)

7. Type: run_hello.bat

8. If the tools are installed correctly, the output should show the various steps in the compilation and execution process ending with the text:
 Hello, world!

If you have previously installed an Evaluation or Lite edition of MPLAB C30 and you wish to upgrade your current installation to the Standard edition, there is no need to re-run the installer unless you also wish to upgrade the currently installed product to the latest release. Once you have obtained a valid license key, from www.microchipdirect.com for example, simply execute the following command line:
 pic30-lm –ulicensekey

If you have a compiler version older than 3.10, download one of the above free editions from our website and then follow the above procedure to upgrade.
